Notes to self
=============

- "Explore":
  - https://github.com/linkedin/luminol for anomaly detection (and correlation if I want)
  - https://github.com/antoinecarme/pyaf for decomposing into long-term trend + periodic component (and forecasting if I want)
  - maybe SVD for correlation of a little bit more than 2 variables
  - => categories of stuff:
    - Correlation
    - Anomaly (TODO name something else, anomaly sounds scary :D -- maybe just Change?)
    - Periodicity (TODO also rename)
    - Trend (if there is sufficient evidence for a long-term trend)
